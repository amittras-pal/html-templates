                period. The company has the right to charge you from time to time according to your membership plan and
                payment terms.</p>

            <p>This is a subscription based service and you will be paying ahead of time in the increments of 12 weeks
                or 24 weeks as you choose from our enrollment page. You will get a self service portal from Zoho
                subscriptions where you can see your subscription details and invoices for the charges.</p>

            <p>Should you decide to leave our program, all you need to do is cancel the subscription from the
                self-service portal. We take customer satisfaction very seriously. We are always available at
                info@StusySelf.com or billing@StusySelf.com if you have any questions/concerns.</p>

            <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Refund Policy</p>

            <p>All our subscriptions are auto renewing by default. As soon as a customer enrolls into our Programs, they
                get a self service portal on Zoho billing system. customers can stop auto renewal at any point of time
                before the next renewal. If a renewal goes through and the card is charged and then the customer wants
                to cancel the subscription for a refund, following procedure will be followed.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Customer needs to send a written request to support@StusySelf.com</li>
                <li>If no classes were attended after the renewal, then 3% transaction fee and $25 administrative fee
                    will be assessed on the refund.</li>
                <li>If some classes were attended, then a prorated amount for the classes along with a 3% transaction
                    fee and $25 administrative fee will be assessed on the refund.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Attendance/Missed Classes Policy</p>

            <p>While we take many precautions, time to time we may cancel classes. It may happen due to many reasons
                such as an emergency for the teacher, technological issues preventing logins, Power outages etc.</p>

            <p>At the same time, a student may also miss a class for any reason.</p>

            <p>If we cancel a class, we will either give a credit on the subscription or move the subscription renewal
                date at the prorated hourly rate for that class.</p>

            <p>If the student misses a class, as a courtesy we make the recording of that class available. Since it is a
                manual process to record the class, there is a chance that the teacher may miss to hit the record
                button. In this scenario, we will offer a 30 mins catchup class on request only.</p>

            <p>Catchup classes are to be scheduled for Friday evenings only and within 3 weeks of incident occurrence.
                We reserve the right to invite more students to that class if we choose to do so.</p>

            <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Student Vacation Policy</p>

            <p>In general, you are paying ahead of time for the services provided. If you choose 12 weeks billing cycle
                with a discount, that means you know you are going to attend the classes during that period.</p>

            <p>You can cancel and reenroll at any point of time, but we do not guarantee a free slot and we do not
                guarantee the same slot availability. In other words, we are holding a spot for you only if you are a
                paid customer.</p>

            <p>We do understand, many times, students take extended vacations to go out of country and such. The biggest
                benefit of an Online program is that one can take classes from anywhere in the world. If that is not a
                possibility, as a courtesy we will hold your student’s spot and give a 1-week credit for any vacations 2
                weeks or more. You need to request a billing credit as we do not have an automated mechanism for this.
            </p>

            <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Promotional Offers Policy</p>

            <p>Time to time we run marketing campaigns to attract new customers. As part of this we may give out very
                generous offers such as a number of free classes to try us out. Unless expressly stated otherwise,</p>

            <ul>
                <li>These offers are only for new customers.</li>
                <li>These offers are to be availed only once per family irrespective of the duration of the prior
                    promotion</li>
                <li>Only for one program per family irrespective of how many students are present in the family</li>
                <li>If you sign-up for multiple programs for one or more students, you are agreeing to be billed for
                    those additional programs</li>

                    remove you from the program and/or charge you as appropriate</li>
