                <p>Located in the fold of The Great Himalayas, Assam is one of the most beautiful states of North-East
                    India. Generated from the fusion of the cultures of Mongolia, mainland India and Burma, the
                    traditions of Assam is truly unique and fascinating for people who have never been to this land. The
                    rocky terrain wrapped up with the blanket of greenery, Assam is a state of ethereal beauty.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Festival of Assam</p>
                <p>Throughout the year, the people of Assam celebrate different colorful and joyous festivals. While all
                    of them are worth attending, the most popular one is Bihu. This festival is celebrated to mark the
                    important times of a cultivator’s life over the cycle of a year. The interesting thing about this
                    festival is, it is non-religious and irrespective of caste and creed, everyone can take part in it.
                </p>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-1.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>Also known as Rongali Bihu, Bohag Bihu is observed in the mid-April to celebrate the beginning of the
                    next sowing season. The next Bihu is celebrated in October when the farmer harvests the crop and
                    brings it to home. This Bihu is known as the Kangali Bihu or Bhogali Bihu. You must attend the
                    colorful functions of Bihu if you are exploring the state during this time.</p>
                <p>Other than Bihu, Ali-AI-Ligang is yet another festival that people of Assam celebrate during Spring.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Traditional Dress</p>
                <p>The traditional Assamese dresses are hand-loomed, colorful and not overly gaudy. The women wear
                    intricately designed mekhela chador or Riha-Mekhela and the men wear dhoti or suria.</p>

                <p>Gamosa is another indispensable part of Assamese attire. You can see the presence of gamosa in almost
                    all socio-religious ceremonies of the land. From the Kamrupi word Gamasa, the words Gamosa has been
                    derived. It is a white colored rectangular piece of fabric made of pure cotton. It has intricately
                    designed red borders on all four sides. You can also find beautiful motif rich gamosas in Assam.</p>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-2.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>Assamese men love to wear dhoti gamosa which is another traditional dress of the state. During the
                    Bihu festival, you can find the gamosa wrapped around the head of the male Bihu dancers. The gamosa
                    is often used to cover the scriptures or the altar of the prayer halls.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Folk Music</p>

                <p>The history of Assam is very long and deep-rooted. So, there is no surprise that the state will be
                    rich in folk music. Since the time of Kamrup Kingdom until the British rule, the culture of Assam
                    has been heavily influenced by each of the rulers. This influence has clearly reflected on the folk
                    music of Assam. The fusion of different cultures gave the folk music of Assam a truly remarkable
                    character.</p>

                <p>The tradition of classical music is also worth mentioning. The classical Assamese music can be
                    divided into two parts. The Ojapali and Borgeet, both of which are a combination of singing and
                    dancing.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Classical Dances</p>

                <p>Satriya, Ojapali and Devdasi are the most important dance styles of Assam. In the Ojapali dance form,
                    the lead dancer narrates a mythological tale. This dance form is a unique fusion of classical dance
                    and acting. Ojapali dance form can also be divided into the following three types.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="fw-bold">Biya-gowa:</span> Narrates the stories of Mahabharat with rhythmic use of
                        feet.</li>
                    <li><span class="fw-bold">Ramayana:</span> It is based on the Assamese version of Ramayan.</li>
                    <li><span class="fw-bold">Sukananni:</span> It worships and celebrates the Snake Goddess, named
                        Manasa.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Devdasi is a conventional dance form that the unmarried women, who dedicated their lives to the god,
                    used to perform in the temples of Assam.</p>

                <p>Along with the classical dances, the folk dances of Assam are also worth mentioning. Bagurumba dance
                    of Bodo tribe and the Jhumur dance form of the Adivasis are truly sublime. If you really want to
                    explore the culture of Assam, make sure to see one of the dance performances while you are here.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Cuisine</p>

                <p>The taste of Assamese dishes is completely different from the spicy cuisine of the rest of the
                    nation. The traditional Assamese dishes are less spicy and mostly non-vegetarian. Rice is the staple
                    food of Assamese people, which is often enjoyed with various fish dishes. The most popular fish
                    preparation is called masor tenga which is tangy and flavorful.</p>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-3.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>Pato diya mas is yet another delicacy of Assam where the fish is wrapped in the banana leaves and
                    baked. Dried fish is the tribal delicacy that you should try while visiting the state. You can also
                    taste various unique tasting meat preparations which are prepared with duck, fowl or mutton.</p>

                <p>The description of the traditional Assamese cuisine will be incomplete if we don’t talk about the
                    sweet dishes of the state. Pitha is one of the most popular sweet dishes that you can find at almost
                    every corner of the state. The variations of the pitha are many, and each of the variations
                    undoubtedly tastes heavenly.</p>

                <p>While most travelers love to explore India, they often do not include the beautiful state of Assam
                    from their itinerary. This is a grave mistake on their part. Visiting Assam is a must if you truly
                    want to explore the diversity of India. With its ecstatic beauty and unique tradition, Assam is
                    waiting to be explored.</p>
