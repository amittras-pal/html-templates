                <p>For some travelers, packing bags before a journey becomes nothing short of a nightmare. As a
                    traveler, I always struggle in this section. Sometimes I tend to overpack while on the other times I
                    do the opposite. I have faced some tough situations in both cases. That’s why I thought about
                    penning down an article about what to pack or not to pack for a journey in the North East Indian
                    States. Check the following section of this article to know about the things you must pack before
                    the journey.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Documents</p>

                <p>As most of the states of North East India have international borders, the level of security you face
                    here is way different than the rest of India. You have to apply for a permit to travel to some of
                    the states.</p>

                <p>Make sure you pack all the relevant permits and id cards while packing the bags. Also, it is a good
                    idea to bring a couple of copies of the id cards and passport size photos along with you.</p>

                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-15.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Clothes</p>

                <p>The weather of the northeastern states of India is mercurial. Even if you are traveling in the summer
                    months, a spell or two of rain can make the weather very chilly.</p>
                So, irrespective of the time you visit these states, make sure to carry woolen clothes. If you are
                traveling during the winter months, be ready to battle biting cold.
                It is wise to avoid shoes with heels. Choose a pair of comfortable shoes for your journey.

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Rain Gear</p>

                <p>It is hard to predict the rains when you are traveling in the northeastern states. So, you should
                    better carry a compact umbrella, windcheater or poncho while traveling to these parts of India.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Medical Kit</p>

                <p>Most of the states in North East India is not developed well. So, it is hard for you to come by a
                    medical store the moment you wish. Make sure that you pack a basic medical kit with you. Make sure
                    to pack sanitary napkins or tampons as well.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Food</p>

                <p>This might seem a bit odd, but you need to carry some food with you. The road trips in the
                    North-Eastern states of India can be long and quite unpredictable. Carrying food along with you will
                    offer some respite. Pack some dry fruits, small treats and packed food for munching.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Cash</p>

                <p>You would find it difficult to locate a functional ATM everywhere in the North-Eastern states. So,
                    you should always carry cash with you. Remember, even the hotels and the homestays here only accept
                    cash as payments. Consider this factor carefully and decide how much money you should carry.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Electronic Devices</p>

                <p>Power cuts are frequent in these Indian states. So, you should always carry torches and power banks
                    with you. It is even better to carry extra batteries for your torches and your camera. The scenic
                    beauty of the place is out of the world. So, if you are a photographer by hobby, make sure to bring
                    adequate memory cards along with you.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Emergency Contacts</p>

                <p>Last but not the least, you should write the names and contact number of the person you want to reach
                    if there’s an accident. Keep the paper inside your wallet as well as in a pouch of your main
                    luggage.</p>

                <p>So, these are the most important things that you need to pack for your northeast India journey. While
                    packing, keep in mind that the terrain of northeast India is difficult and you have to carry your
                    luggage yourself. Only pack the necessary items. The above list will sort some of your troubles, but
                    if you don’t think rationally while packing, you can still end up in the same trap.</p>
