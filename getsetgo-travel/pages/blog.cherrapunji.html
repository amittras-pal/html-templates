                <p>Are you a Nature Lover? Then Cherrapunji can become one of the breathtaking options for your upcoming
                    holidays. Here is an ultimate guide that will help you to traverse through the less crowded yet
                    spectacularly beautiful place located in North East India. Read on to get all the essential
                    information that will help you to place the trip.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Why Is Cherrapunji Famous?</p>

                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-4.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>Locally known as Sohra, Cherrapunji is also known as the abode of clouds. Tucked into the lap of the
                    serene Khasi Hills, Cherrapunji is located right in the middle of Meghalaya. The pristine nature and
                    the serene beauty of the valleys will soothe your eyes the moment you step in Meghalaya. The
                    swirling rivers, floating clouds, and the breathtaking waterfalls will embrace your soul with their
                    unabashed beauty.</p>

                <p>Even though Meghalaya is breathtakingly beautiful, the beauty of Chrrapunji is of another level. The
                    yearlong rainfall has boosted the growth of the forest and trees in general. Once you come here, you
                    will feel as if nature is beckoning you to explore her depth. The beauty of Cherrapunji not only
                    leaves you breathless but also evokes deep respect for Mother Nature.</p>

                <p>It is the incessant rainfalls that have made this place famous to the world. Unlike most places
                    across the world, rain here is not measured in millimetres. The people of his small village measures
                    rainfall in feet. The small town once even secured a place in the Guinness Book for being the
                    wettest place in the world. Even though Mawsynram has snatched that crown from the town, it still
                    holds the record of highest recorded rainfall in a single year.</p>

                <p>If you think that the stunning scenic beauty is the only thing that Cherrapunji offers, think again.
                    The double-decker living root bridge is yet another wondrous thing that Cherrapunji offers to
                    travelers. Invented and constructed by the aboriginal tribes, these bridges are a fine specimen of
                    excellent bioengineering. You have to travel to the village Nongrighat to see this unique bride.
                    Needless to say, you do not get to see these types of bridges anywhere across the world.</p>
                <p>Apart from the famous bridges, there are lots of other not so famous root bridges, waterfalls, caves,
                    and treehouses in Cherrapunji which you can visit. Among all the falls, the Nohkalikai waterfalls is
                    a must-visit place. Plunging from the reefs of the Khasi hills, this falls is the tallest waterfall
                    of India and the 4th highest one across the world.</p>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-5.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">History</p>

                <p>Even though most people are not aware of it, but Cherrapunji has a long historical legacy. From the
                    16th Century to 18th Century the Syiems used to rule the land. The term Syiem means ruler or chief.
                    The name of the last significant Syiem of Khasi Hills was Tirot Sing. In 1883, after the demise of
                    Tirot Singh, the rule of the land goes to the British authorities.</p>

                <p>It was Britishers who changed the name Sohra into Chrrapunji. Local legends indicate that British
                    rulers were not able to pronounce Sohra properly. They tend to pronounce it as Churra. Over time,
                    this mispronunciation became Cherrapunji, thus changing the name of the land in the process.
                    Recently, the Government of Meghalaya has changed the name of Cherrapunji and renamed it Sohra.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Geography</p>

                <p>If you want to know Cherrapunji like the back of your hand, you have to learn its geography first.
                    Even though the Khasi Hills do not look like it, the town is located about 4869 feet above the sea
                    level. Cherrapunji sits atop a plateau that is about 600 meters higher than the surrounding valleys.
                    This extra height enables Cherrapunji to offer such ethereal sights to the travelers.</p>

                <p>From Cherrapunji, one can even see the plain lands of Sylhet of neighboring Bangladesh. Here, no
                    matter where you go and where you look, you will only see greenery. Cherrapunji is also home to
                    diverse plants and vegetations. The subtropical forest of Meghalaya is, in fact, one of the oldest
                    forests in the world. The best thing about these forests is that it is largely still untouched. This
                    gives the modern travelers a unique chance to revere and love the beauties of Mother Nature, which
                    we are obliterating at a blinding rate in the rest of the world. For travelers who love nature and
                    want to get rejuvenated, Cherrapunji offers a piece of heaven.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Weather and Rainfall</p>

                <p>As we have already told, when it comes to rainfalls, the weather here is pretty consistent. Right
                    now, Cherrapunji holds two different Guinness world records; one for experiencing the maximum amount
                    of rainfall in a year and the other one is for recording maximum rainfall in a month. As it receives
                    both the south-west winds as well as the North East winds, the monsoon dominates the rest of the
                    seasons.</p>

                <p>Thanks to the dominating monsoons, Cherrapunji has retained its lush green beauty for years. Here,
                    you can spend hours sitting at the balcony, sipping piping hot coffee while taking in the misty
                    beauty of soaked hills. If you are a bit adventurous, then you can wrap up a raincoat and go for a
                    walk. The crystal clear streams, intriguing trekking routes and the mesmerizing natural caves will
                    not disappoint you. Cherrapunji is the perfect place for forgetting all the stress of daily life and
                    soaking in the intoxicating energy of nature.</p>

                <p>Incessant rainfall can dampen the mood of a sunny weather lover; monsoon is the best season to visit
                    Cherrapunji if you want to see the waterfalls at their full might. This might be the only time when
                    you can see the seven streams of the seven sisters’ fall gushing from the cliff.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Summer</p>

                <p>Summer starts here in March and stretches till May. Unlike the rest of India, summer is not scorching
                    here. With pleasant temperature and moderate rains, summer could be the best time for you to travel
                    here.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Winter</p>

                <p>The rain stops only when winter arrives. While you can experience a spell or two of rain during this
                    time, winter is generally considered as a dry month here. The weather becomes chilly during this
                    time as temperature drops significantly. However, this is the only season when you can visit scenic
                    places without caring about Umbrella or Raincoats.</p>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-6.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">

                <p class="fw-bold text-danger">Clothing Guide</p>

                <p>Like visiting most of the hill stations, you should carry light woolen clothes in summer and the
                    heavy ones if you are traveling in winter months. However, don’t forget to carry a raincoat or
                    umbrella with you irrespective of the time of the year.</p>

                <p>Even though monsoon is the best time to visit Cherrapunji if you want to witness the roaring beauty
                    of the waterfalls, Cherrapunji greets the traveler with its astounding beauty every season. So, if
                    you want to take a break from the maddening city life, pack your bags and visit Cherrapunji to revel
                    in the serenity of nature.</p>
