                                    content, is nothing more that an online brochure for your company. A successful
                                    website will interact with consumers and provide new and up to date information and
                                    content. Also, in terms of SEO, Google much prefers a website that is consistently
                                    updated. There’s no specific time limit on updating your website, just make sure it
                                    stays relevant. For ideas on how to update your website, check out our blog on,

                                A blog is the most commonly used platform for sharing marketing content. In fact, in
                                2019 55% of marketers say that blogging is their number one marketing priority. This is
                                because blogs appeal to consumers by providing them with entertainment and relevant
                                information. Blogging can be used for literally any business, from a local fashion
                                boutique to a law firm to a construction company. So in a nutshell, yes, we definitely
                                recommend having a blog. Read our blog on ‘The 6 Most Common Blogging Mistakes’ to learn

                            <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website
                                or a web page in a search engine’s “natural” or un-paid (“organic”) search results. In
                                general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently
                                a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the
                                search engine’s users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search,
                                local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical
                                search engines.</p>
                            <p>As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people
                                search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which
                                search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may
                                involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance
                                to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search
                                engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is
                                another SEO tactic.</p>

                            <p>Keywords and keyword phrases are a central element of search engine optimization. In its
                                most basic definition a keyword or keyword phrase is the text a web user types into a
                                search box to find relevant information or content. Phrased another way, keywords are
                                descriptions of the information people are searching for and can bring targeted traffic
                                to your website.

                                Choosing the best keywords for your website and SEO optimization is very important for
                                getting targeted traffic to your website with the greatest chance of converting them to
                                customers and repeat visitors. Effective use of keywords is essential for ranking well
                                and being found on the Internet. Keyword research is focused on locating the optimal
                                keyword phrases for drawing targeted traffic to a website.</p>
                            <p>Keyword research can frequently be dry and very detailed oriented. To do it well it
                                requires special software tools and experience. However, this type of research and the
                                information it provides is the cornerstone of any successful SEO effort. Many people
                                also consider the optimal use of keyword phrases to be essential for creating and
                                maintaining a successful website as keywords will appear in the website’s page content,

                            <p>The Web is a dynamic place and the search engine results pages (SERPs) can change on a
                                frequent basis. This can be frustrating to website owners as one day they may rank
                                number 2 for an important keyword phrase and two days later they may rank number 5.</p>
                            <p>While these changes can be disconcerting to a website owner or business, they should be
                                taken in context. By having a broader web presence that is not solely dependent on the
                                rank of a given keyword in the search engines results pages a business lessens its
                                dependency on any single source of web traffic. Diversity is important.</p>
