            <h1 class="fw-bold">MOBILE APP BENEFITS FOR BUSINESS: TEN REASONS TO INVEST</h1>
            <p>These days, it is next to impossible to find a person who is not using a mobile phone. In fact, many
                people use two. Since long, mobile phones have changed from being a very expensive means of urgent
                communication to a common device combining the functions of Internet access point, social network
                platform, camera, alarm clock, organizer… Oh, yes, and you can make calls with it, too.</p>

            <p>With the advance of smartphones, your mobile telephone has become your window to the Internet. All mobile
                operating systems support mobile versions of popular browsers, and you can surf the web from anywhere –
                a café, a car, a country house, a beach… The only thing you need is a strong Wi-Fi signal or enough
                gigabytes on your mobile internet account.</p>

            <p>With such popularity of mobile phones, it would be extremely unwise not to use it for the benefit of your
                business. Nowadays, developing a mobile app for a business is one of the primary development tasks. When
                a company is providing services to people and is focused on individual users, it must find the way to
                always be within the arm's reach. What's in common between a lady having her hair done at the
                hairdresser's, a student waiting for a bus at the bus stop, and a businessman who has just placed his
                order for a lunch at a restaurant? All of them are holding their smartphones in their hands.</p>

            <p>According to the survey, about 90% of the total time users spend with their mobile devices they spend on
                mobile applications, which leaves only 10% for mobile browsers.</p>

            <h3 class="text-danger">
                Benefits of Mobile Apps for Business
            </h3>

            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">Better visibility and brand awareness.</span> One of the fundamentals
                of a successful promotion is being constantly visible to your customers. Today people do not look up at
                billboards, they look down to their smartphones. A mobile application reminds users of the company, its
                brand, its services and prompts to browse for more. When creating a mobile app for your business, make
                sure that all company values are properly presented, that the UI is truly smart and usable and that your
                advertising is not annoying and bothering for your customers. This way, customers will return to it over
                and over.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">Competitive advantage.</span> There are hundreds of companies providing
                similar services, so what can make a customer opt for yours? Being literally in their pocket, of course.
                If you urgently need a taxi in a strange city and you do not know your exact address, you will not call
                a taxi company over the phone, you will use an application installed on your mobile device. All of them
                have geolocation functionality, so resolving your position won't be a problem.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">Customer loyalty.</span>Engaging a customer is just half the battle,
                you also need them to come back. This is one of the main reasons for making a mobile application for
                your business – if you have provided excellent service the first time and customers know how to find you
                again easily, they will definitely return. And for customers to easily find your business, it has to be
                very close wherever they are – they need to carry it with them, in their mobile phones.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">Constant availability to customers.</span> Obviously, an application in
                your telephone will be what you first think about when you need a certain service. Sometimes, a mobile
                application can be a true lifesaver – for example, if you urgently need to increase your credit card
                limit, a mobile application from your bank will be more than handy. And some mobile apps can perform
                basic functions even when offline, contrary to mobile browsers which are totally useless with no
                Internet connection.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">Cost-effectiveness.</span> Of course, building a mobile application for
                your business has its cost – you need to engage a qualified mobile development team, provide resources,
                create and support the infrastructure for smooth app performance and constant availability, and some
                more. However, compare these costs with the expenses for outdoor advertising or TV commercial, and then
                don't forget to compare the return on your investment. A person seeing a visual ad is not your customer
                yet, but a person who has downloaded your app is already with you. So, in the long run, the cost you've
                invested into creating a solid, user-friendly mobile application will pay back faster than those paid
                for various advertising.</p>

            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">Easiness of use and time savings.</span> For your customers, these
                features are priceless. Imagine searching for boarding passes in a large carry-on bag at a crowded
                airport. Long lines, various controls, overwhelming rush – and you are beginning to panic and seem to be
                doing everything wrong. Or, if you have your airline's mobile app on your smartphone, you just tap your
                screen and your boarding pass is there in a second. Just scan the QR code – and have a nice flight. And
                they are paperless, too, therefore, environment-friendly.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">Use of mobile device features.</span> Mobile applications, unlike
                mobile browsers, can be made to integrate the features of mobile devices – camera, GPS, accelerometer,
                various screen actions such as swiping, pinching, tapping, dragging. This makes mobile app management
                and use much easier, more intuitive and attractive for customers. At the same time, the mobile device
                features integrated into an application can create truly unique and elaborate designs.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">Social media presence.</span> The effect of social media cannot be
                overestimated. If you integrate social media into your mobile app (the easiest and the most
                straightforward method is enabling login with a social network account, for example, through Facebook),
                you can make use of social media functionality – likes, shares, photo postings, instant messaging, and
                so on.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">A complement to your desktop application version.</span> If using
                mobile applications in business has so many benefits, does it mean that it can remain the only channel
                customers can get your service? Absolutely not. Despite the growing popularity of mobile devices, the
                share of desktop users is still rather large, so your marketing strategy should cater for them, too.
                Creating a perfect package with mobile and web applications will help your business reach out to all the
                groups of your target audience and increase your competitiveness.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold text-danger">Development facilities.</span> If the marketing sector has recognized
                the advantages of the increasing popularity of mobile applications, custom software development sector
                has recognized them as well. Nowadays, you can find dozens of platforms and tools for custom mobile
                application development and hundreds of ready third-party services which can be reused during your
                application creation. Many developers choose mobile applications as their primary area, as they see the
                growing demand in this market sector.</p>
