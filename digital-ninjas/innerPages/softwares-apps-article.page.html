            <h1 class="fw-bold">Software as a Service: Characteristics and Benefits</h1>
            <p>Software as a service (SaaS), an innovative branch of cloud computing, has been embraced by businesses
                across
                the globe for the unique benefits it brings to the table. SaaS involves the delivery of applications in
                the
                form of service over the internet. With SaaS, businesses and individuals need not install and maintain
                software; instead, they can simply access the software via the internet, liberating themselves from the
                management of complex hardware and software.</p>

            <p>Software as a service application is also referred to as hosted software, on-demand software, or
                web-based
                software. SaaS applications run on the servers of a SaaS provider. Access to the application is managed
                by
                the provider, including its performance, availability, and security.</p>

            <p>The valuable software as a service characteristic helps individuals and businesses work more efficiently.
                As
                reported by Transparency Market Research, the SaaS market is likely to reach $164.29 billion by 2022.
            </p>


            <h3 class="text-danger">Software as a Service Characteristics</h3>

            <p>To understand the software as a service model, think of a bank. A bank provides service that’s secure and
                reliable, on a huge scale, while protecting each customer’s privacy. All the customers of a bank employ
                the
                same technology and use the same financial systems without worrying about any unauthorized access to
                their
                personal information.</p>

            <p>A bank matches the key software as a service characteristic. Let’s have a look at these characteristics:
            </p>

            <p class="fw-bold text-dark">Multitenant Architecture</p>

            <p>A multitenant architecture is one where all applications and users share a common code base and
                infrastructure that’s centrally maintained. As all SaaS vendor clients use the same code base and
                infrastructure, vendors can innovate faster, saving valuable development time that was spent previously
                to
                maintain many outdated code versions.</p>

            <p class="fw-bold text-dark">Easy Customization</p>

            <p>Each user can easily customize applications to suit their business processes without touching the common
                infrastructure. Due to how SaaS is architected, the customizations are unique to every user or business
                and
                are preserved through the upgrades. This implies that SaaS providers can carry out upgrades more
                frequently
                with low customer risk.</p>

            <p class="fw-bold text-dark">Better Access</p>

            <p>Improved access to data is another important characteristic of SaaS in cloud computing. Users can enjoy
                better data access from networked devices and have the ease of managing privileges, monitoring data use,
                while ensuring the same information is seen by everyone at a time.</p>

            <h3 class="text-danger">Software as a Service Benefits: How It’s Impacting Business</h3>
            <p class="text-danger fw-bold">1. Affordability</p>

            <p>As software as a service involves businesses leasing software rather than owning, the pricing model is
                much different. Instead of paying a one-off charge, businesses pay a subscription fee every month, which
                depends on the number of users. SaaS eliminates the capex costs, allowing smaller businesses to afford
                applications that previously they could not afford.</p>

            <p>SaaS applications are also easier to manage since payments are secured as predictable monthly
                installments, preventing IT budgets from becoming overly complicated.</p>

            <p class="text-danger fw-bold">2. Time Savings</p>

            <p>With SaaS, businesses don’t need to install, configure, and manage the software themselves. These
                administrative duties are handled by the cloud vendor, which means your staff can concentrate on the
                more valuable aspects of their jobs. Businesses also don’t need to worry about software updates as the
                third-party supplier handles the patches and updates.</p>

            <p>Software updates are more incremental and frequent when you leverage a cloud supplier, which means you
                can achieve improved software maintenance.</p>

            <p class="text-danger fw-bold">3. Mobility
            </p>
            <p>A notable benefit of cloud technology is mobility, which is offered by SaaS at a much higher degree than
                that offered by traditional software options. As you can access applications through an internet
                connection, you can use them employing any compatible device at any location. This implies that
                employees can work whenever and wherever they need to, being productive even on the move.</p>

            <p>As more and more devices are being used in the workplace, like smartphones, IoT (Internet of Things)
                products, and more, there’s an increased need to access the software through different devices.</p>
