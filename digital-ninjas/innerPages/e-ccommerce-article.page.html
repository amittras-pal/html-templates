            <h1 class="text-danger fw-bold">5 Key Benefits of e-Commerce for Your Business</h1>
            <p>Having been around for more than 10 years, e-commerce can no longer be considered as a new field in
                retail. Still, it’s one of the most prominent retail vectors — according to Nielsen, online shopping
                accounts for $2.8 trillion. Although the shifts to online sectors are most obvious in FMCG, Electronics,
                and Clothes, other markets will soon join the trend. After all, e-commerce grows 20% each year — in
                2020, it’ll reach approximately $4 trillion.</p>

            <p>Even if we talk about present realities, it’s apparent that e-commerce is a promising investment vector.
                If the market keeps up this growth pace, by 2037 online sales could exceed physical store profits.</p>

            <p>By transferring a business to online mediums, owners receive access to new audiences. They also get
                superior metrics, monitoring possibilities, branding instruments, and innovative technologies — all
                these additional opportunities make working online easier than offline.</p>
            <h3 class="text-danger">Advantages of e-Commerce for Your Business</h3>
            <p>Following global trends and planning future developments is undoubtedly important, but that’s not all
                that e-commerce offers. The field is already huge — you can explore e-commerce advantages that help your
                business grow now.</p>

            <h4 class="text-danger">Power of Competition</h4>
            <p>The e-commerce field is highly competitive, and although it may seem like a disadvantage at first glance,
                competition is a highly effective development driver. The valuable distinction between physical and
                online stores is that in digital mediums, your competitors’ activities are publically available. You can
                use Similar Web to monitor their traffic, subscribe to newsletters to track new offers, and follow
                social media to learn their branding tactics.</p>

            <p>In e-commerce, the competition is open and transparent — it’s one of the main advantages and
                disadvantages of e-commerce. You are free to learn from their mistakes and make the most out of their
                business models. Still, it’s important to be careful with your competitors — they can monitor your
                strategy, too</p>
            <h4 class="text-danger">Helps To Keep Up With Higher Demands</h4>

            <p>Adapting to e-commerce brings you closer to the market, and more importantly, keeps you in touch with the
                end customer. Google Analytics and Shopify provide access to behavioral statistics, letting business
                owners and managers know main customer interactions. By integrating a Customer Relationship Manager
                system, you can send personalized emails, monitor conversion, work with potential clients, and send
                automated follow-ups.</p>

            <p>It’s also worth noting that e-commerce customers are highly selective in their choices. Although there is
                room for an impulsive purchase, the majority of online shoppers like to read reviews, collect
                information about the company, and do detailed research. They also expect the website to provide them
                with useful information — a customer won’t search for a product or its description if it’s not
                publically available.</p>

            <p>These high demands inspire your business to grow to a new level, which is why it’s one of the main
                benefits of e-commerce. Luckily, you don’t have to necessarily invest monetary resources — there are
                plenty of free tools that allow for improved website management and high-level analytics.</p>

            <h4 class="text-danger">Lower Costs of Maintenance and Management</h4>
            <p>It’s proven that e-commerce can be more efficient and cheaper than physical retail. Let’s take a look at
                how online stores can lower their maintenance expenses compared to brick-and-mortar shops.</p>

            <p><span class="fw-bold">Accurate reporting:</span> an online store can navigate automated integrations with
                invoicing software and accounting managers. This leads to faster financial operations and protects a
                business from potential penalties.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">Less additional costs:</span> all resources that were previously directed to
                electricity, rent, or building repair can be redirected to marketing and advertising.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">Inventory management:</span> an online store doesn’t have to own a warehouse.
                Instead, a company can outsource the work to wholesalers or rent space. No time-consuming organization,
                storage, logistical issues, and unpacking problems.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">Communication:</span> e-commerce allows retailers to talk to their employees via
                online messengers and social media. Clients are approached via social media, email, mobile phones, and
                messaging apps. All dialogue logs are stored in dedicated management tools.</p>
            <h4 class="text-danger">Final Thoughts</h4>
            <p>Implementing e-commerce is a must-have retail innovation in 2020. Data algorithms and tech innovations
                provide customers with a life-like experience, and analytics help to measure business’ growth. All these
                factors make online store development faster and easier as well.</p>

            <p>When we know customers’ online habits, preferences, interests, and pain points, we start looking for an
                optimal technical solution. This test-based and data-driven approach saves money and time in the
                long-term run and assures quick progress. Contact us if you have an e-commerce or m-commerce project in
                mind — our team will happily analyze the market and create a sustainable cutting-edge digital store!</p>
