                <p class="fw-bold">If you routinely forget where you put your keys or why you walked into a room, then
                    it's time to start thinking about amping up your nutrition to help your brain out.</p>
                <p>The research on links between brain function and nutrition is exploding — and it turns out that your
                    diet has an effect on cognition, memory and your risk of getting dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
                </p>

                <p>We polled registered dietitians on the one fruit you should eat more often for neuroprotection. Their
                    opinions are rooted in evidence-based research on the role of food and brain health.</p>

                <h3>Why Blueberries Are Good for Your Brain</h3>
                <h4>1. They're Rich in Antioxidants</h4>
                <p>"A daily handful (or more) of blueberries is ideal for keeping the brain healthy and young brain,"
                    says Cheryl Mussatto, RDN and author of ​The Nourished Brain​. "It's one strategy to forestall or
                    possibly reverse age-related cognitive deficits."</p>

                <p>Blueberries contain antioxidants called flavonoids that are largely responsible for the brain health
                    benefits seen in research. A June 2021 systematic review in the ​International Journal of Molecular
                    Sciences​ found that the compounds in berries are linked to reduced cognitive decline and
                    improvements in memory. It's important to note that the majority of the studies in the review tested
                    with blueberries, blueberry powder or juice.</p>

                <p>"Blueberries provide anthocyanin, a powerful antioxidant linked with anti-inflammatory properties,
                    explains registered dietitian Lisa Andrews, RD. "As part of the MIND diet, blueberries are an
                    excellent snack for brain health."</p>

                <p>Mussato agrees: "Thanks to the polyphenolic compounds found in this sweet berry, oxidative stress and
                    inflammation are lowered helping destroy free radicals that can damage brain cells."</p>

                <p>And we can thank the anthocyanins in blueberries for the fruit's health-promoting effects, not just
                    on cognition and neuroprotection, but also for reduced risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes,
                    along with weight maintenance, per a March 2020 review in ​Advances in Nutrition.​</p>

                <h4>2. They're Tied to a Lower Risk of Neurodegenerative Diseases</h4>
                <p>The MIND diet stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. As you can see,
                    it is a blend of the Mediterranean diet pattern and the DASH diet, which stands for Dietary
                    Approaches to Stop Hypertension. That's all the acronyms for now.</p>

                <p>The MIND diet burst onto the diet scene less than 10 years ago and a February 2015 study in
                    ​Alzheimer's and Dementia​ found that strictly sticking to it was associated with a 53 percent
                    reduced risk of dementia. Get excited folks, because even following the diet moderately was linked
                    to a 35 percent reduced risk. Those are good numbers.</p>

                <p>"Blueberries are a great snack for brain health," says registered dietitian Christina Iaboni, RD.
                    "Both the MIND Diet and Mediterranean diet have been shown to have brain-protective benefits, and
                    blueberries are part of both diets. The MIND diet specifically suggests eating berries two or more
                    times per week."</p>

                <h4>3. They're Linked to Better Mood</h4>
                <p>Blueberries of all types have been studied also for their effects on mental health conditions, such
                    as depression and anxiety.</p>

                <p>Freeze-dried blueberry powder was used to study mood symptoms in children and young adults.
                    Researchers observed that blueberries improved depression symptoms in both groups, but there was no
                    change in anxiety, according to a February 2017 report in ​Nutrients​.</p>

                <p>Similar findings came out of a March 2020 study in the ​British Journal of Nutrition​, where 12 to
                    17-year-olds were given wild blueberry powder and reported fewer depressive symptoms after only 4
                    weeks.</p>

                <p>And, a review that looked at the effects of berry polyphenols on cognitive function saw that various
                    forms of blueberry was linked to improved cognitive function in older adults, according to a 2022
                    review in ​Scientific Reports​.</p>
                <div class="my-3 bg-light rounded p-3 shadow border border-dark">
                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-danger">Tip</h3>
                    <p>While blueberries show promising effects on mood disorders, eating them doesn't replace taking
                        medication. If you're on medication for depression, anxiety or another condition, don't quit
                        your meds without talking to your doctor first.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>How Many Blueberries Should You Eat?</h3>
                <p>First of all, you don't need to eat blueberries every day. It's very beneficial to have a wide
                    variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet, as produce is rich in powerful antioxidants.</p>

                <p>But if you want to add more berries to your diet, Mussato says that a handful of blueberries will do
                    the trick for a healthy brain.</p>

                <p>This is right in line with what research shows: March 2020 research in ​Advances in Nutrition​ found
                    that just a 1/3 cup of blueberries daily — fresh or frozen — imparts health benefits. So you could
                    combine this serving and have a cup of blueberries a few times a week and still gain the health
                    perks.</p>
