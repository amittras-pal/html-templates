                <p class="fw-bold">Regularly stepping on the scale can help you keep tabs on your weight-loss progress.
                    But you'll get the most useful information when you weigh in at the right time.</p>

                <p> "Hopping on the scale at regular intervals helps you be more accountable to yourself about your
                    weight," explains Lisa R. Young, PhD, RD, adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University and
                    author of ​Finally Full, Finally Slim​.</p>

                <p>While there's no one-size-fits-all answer for what that might look like, experts ​do​ agree on a few
                    key factors for successful weight tracking. Here's how to determine the best time to weigh yourself,
                    how often you should do it and what to do if stepping on the scale seems to be causing more harm
                    than good.</p>

                <h3>The Best Time to Weigh Yourself</h3>
                <p>While you can get a ballpark estimate of your weight at any time of the day (or night), you'll get
                    the most accurate results by stepping on the scale first thing in the morning, according to the
                    Cleveland Clinic. (That's after you've emptied your bladder, but before you've taken a bite of
                    breakfast or sip of coffee.) Wait until later in the day, and food and liquids sitting in your
                    digestive tract can change your results.</p>

                <p>Try to use the scale on the same day each week, too. Findings published in the February 2014 issue of
                    ​Obesity Facts​ show that our weight tends to increase over the weekends, when we're more likely to
                    treat ourselves. Weigh yourself on Sunday morning after Saturday night's rich restaurant dinner, and
                    the number might read a little higher than normal for you.</p>

                <p>For that very reason, Young likes to make Tuesday the standard weigh-in day. "Monday is too close to
                    the weekend. Tuesday gives you most of the week to improve your habits for the week," she says.</p>

                <p>If weighing in at another time or day works better for you, that's OK too. Just be consistent. "Aim
                    for the same day each week, at the same time," says Seattle-based nutrition expert Liz Wyosnick, RD.
                </p>

                <h3>How Often to Weigh Yourself</h3>
                <p>Research suggests that daily weigh-ins may be the most effective for weight loss. In an October 2019
                    study in the ​Journal of Behavioral Medicine​, adults who weighed themselves six or seven times a
                    week lost around 1.7 percent of their body weight within a year. Those who checked in with the scale
                    just once a week didn't lose anything.</p>

                <p>Not all experts agree that weighing daily is best, though. Stepping on the scale every day might
                    cause a person to focus more on achieving a certain number than developing healthy eating and
                    exercise habits that can support long-term success.</p>

                <p>"I advise people to weigh themselves no more and no less than one time per week," Wyosnick says.
                    "Safe and sustainable weight loss is not found within minor fluctuations of body weight from one day
                    to the next. It is better to assess progress over a longer time allotted for practice and adoption
                    of your new habits."</p>

                <p>Young, too, recommends stepping on the scale just once or twice a week. "We have daily fluctuations,
                    and for some people, daily weighing can lead to obsessing about weight, which you don't want," she
                    says.</p>

                <h3>6 More Tips for Weighing Yourself</h3>
                <p>Looking for more advice on how to make the most of your weigh-ins? Keep these tips in mind.</p>

                <h4>1. Wear the Same Thing Every Time</h4>
                <p>Stepping on the scale naked will give you the most accurate reading. But if you'd rather weigh
                    yourself with clothes on, that's fine too. Just aim to wear the same type of outfit each time and
                    avoid anything too bulky or heavy, like a jacket or shoes.</p>

                <p>"Wearing a T-shirt and underwear is good," Young says.</p>

                <p>Prefer to hop on the scale after exercising? That works, but remember to take off your sneakers
                    first.</p>

                <h4>2. Use a Digital Scale</h4>
                <p>They'll give you a more precise reading compared to old-fashioned spring-loaded scales, according to
                    the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

                <p>Make sure to place the scale on firm, even flooring like wood or tile instead of a softer surface
                    like carpet.</p>

                <h4>3. Track Your Progress</h4>
                <p>Taking note of your number each week can help you spot general trends, even if there's an instance
                    where you don't lose as much as you were expecting.</p>

                <p>Research in the March 2021 issue of ​Obesity​ suggests that logging your weight in a digital app is
                    tied to the greatest weight-loss success. (And there are plenty of great options to choose from.)
                    But if you'd rather go low-tech, a notebook and pen get the job done too.</p>

                <h4>4. Don't Panic Over Some Weight Gain</h4>
                <p>One higher-than-expected reading doesn't mean you're a failure. In fact, the average adult's weight
                    can fluctuate by as much as 4 pounds over the course of just a few days, according to a July 2017
                    study in ​Physiological Reports​.</p>

                <p>Blips on the weight radar can happen due to hormonal fluctuations, sodium consumption and even
                    whether you've had a bowel movement recently, Wyosnick says.</p>

                <p>"Stay consistent with your weight-loss practices, and only once your weight has not budged for six to
                    eight weeks, then consider a different approach," she says.</p>

                <h4>5. Find Other Measures of Success Too</h4>
                <p>Weight-loss progress comes from regularly engaging in healthy behaviors. So instead of ​just​ paying
                    attention to what the scale says, keep track of the good-for-you habits that are driving your
                    success too.</p>

                <p>"Nobody lost weight just by weighing themselves," says Wyosnick. "So rather, many times I have people
                    track their physical activity minutes, water intake or consumption of non-starchy vegetables. These
                    parameters are much more in your control, and with time, will lead to the desired outcome."</p>

                <h4>6. Stop if Weighing Triggers Negative Feelings</h4>
                <p>Consider giving the scale a break if weighing leaves you feeling lousy or triggers unhealthy eating
                    or exercise behaviors, Young says. You should also avoid weighing yourself if you have a history of
                    an eating disorder, recommends the Cleveland Clinic.</p>

                <p>Instead of using pounds to guide your progress, focus on Wyosnick's success metrics that are within
                    your control, or pay attention to how your clothes are fitting. "It's important to realize that the
                    scale is simply a guide," Young says.</p>
