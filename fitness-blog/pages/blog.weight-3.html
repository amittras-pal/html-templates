                <p class="fw-bold">Although healthy eating and exercise are a big part of any weight-loss plan, there's
                    a third (pretty important) factor you may be missing: social support.</p>
                <p>They're an underrated weight-loss tool, but social support systems or programs may have a bigger
                    effect on your weight-loss success than you think.</p>

                <p>Learn how, exactly, social support can help you reach your goals and where you can find it.</p>

                <h3>3 Reasons Social Support Helps With Weight Loss</h3>
                <h4>1. It Keeps You Motivated</h4>
                <p>One of the biggest benefits of having a social support system is motivation. Weight-loss progress
                    isn't always linear (one week you may lose a pound, only to gain it back two weeks later).</p>

                <p>Especially when you feel discouraged, knowing you have friends or a community in your corner can help
                    you keep progressing toward your goal, Fatima Cody Stanford, MD, MPH, an obesity medicine
                    physician-scientist, tells LIVESTRONG.com.</p>

                <p>"Social support tells the individual that they are not alone," she says. "Many of my patients with
                    obesity often feel alone even though obesity is the most prevalent chronic disease of our time. No
                    one should feel alone."</p>

                <p>The people around you may have a bigger effect on your progress than you expect. Generally, people
                    who start a weight-loss program with friends have better success meeting their goals and maintaining
                    their progress, according to an older but still-cited February 1999 study in the ​[Journal of
                    Consulting and Clinical Psychology​](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10028217/).</p>

                <p>A February 2016 study in ​Childhood Obesity​ had similar findings. Adolescent women who relied on
                    encouragement from family and friends were more successful in meeting their weight-loss goals.</p>

                <h4>2. It Encourages Accountability</h4>
                <p>Social support systems can come in many different forms (more on that below), including friends and
                    family, apps or community-based programs. Different systems work for different people, but all of
                    these provide a source of accountability, which can be a big encouraging factor.</p>

                <p>People who have accountability partners or programs are usually better able to reach their goals, Dr.
                    Stanford says. Whether it's reporting to a friend each week or checking off goals on an app, having
                    a system that keeps you accountable can encourage you to keep progressing toward your goals.</p>

                <h4>3. You Can Learn New Tools</h4>
                <p>Outside resources can also teach you how to better handle and navigate any of the bumps you may
                    encounter on the road, Dr. Stanford says. As mentioned earlier, progress isn't always linear, and in
                    some cases, you may not know the solution when setbacks come along.</p>

                <p>But having a community means you get to problem-solve together. Chances are, others have encountered
                    the same issues and may be able to suggest solutions that worked for them.</p>

                <p>Similarly, most apps or digital programs have pages and pages of information and tips or tricks to
                    help make your weight-loss journey a little easier.</p>

                <h3> Social Support Systems and Programs to Try</h3>
                <p>Before you start testing different systems, Dr. Stanford recommends you think about whether outside
                    support is best for you. Although social support can help you meet your goals, it's not for everyone
                    and isn't the only successful strategy. Some people prefer to achieve their goals solo, and that's
                    totally OK. Or, you may prefer to start alone and reach out for support several months down the
                    line. Bottom line: It's a totally personal decision.</p>

                <p>But if you're set on trying a social support program or system, there are a few avenues to try:</p>

                <h4>1. Friends and Family</h4>
                <p>Your personal relationships play a big part in your overall wellbeing, and that includes navigating
                    weight loss, Dr. Stanford says. More specifically, long-term support is often necessary in reaching
                    milestones.</p>

                <p>In many cases, friends and family may be able to provide all the support you need in your journey.
                    But that doesn't mean that every relationship is ideal in this context. After all, you want support
                    from someone you trust and can rely on when things get challenging — and who will encourage you to
                    keep up your progress.</p>

                <p>Think of friends or family members who are comfortable having open conversations about your
                    weight-loss goals. Work together to set up expectations, whether that's meeting once a week to
                    discuss your progress or sending daily text messages. This is personal preference, but the key is to
                    find a mutual, positive understanding.</p>

                <h4>2. Weight-Loss Programs</h4>
                <p>There are plenty of weight-loss programs out there, but that doesn't mean they're all positive or
                    provide the social support you're looking for. These are a few options you can consider:</p>

                <h4>​WW​</h4>

                <p>A digital program you can purchase online and use on your phone or computer, WW (formerly known as
                    Weight Watchers) is a personalized weight-loss plan that helps you change your lifestyle rather than
                    simply meet a target number on the scale.</p>

                <p>When it comes to social support, WW has a big online community through social platforms like Facebook
                    and Instagram where you can connect with other users or explore the company's informational posts.
