                <p class="fw-bold">There's no arguing that fish is delish. But when it comes to how seafood might affect
                    the number on the scale, the answer isn't so clear-cut.</p>
                <p>While fish can — and should! — be part of a healthy diet, including one geared toward weight loss,
                    serving it the wrong way could end up doing more harm than good. So how much should you be having,
                    what's the best way to cook it and do higher-fat options like salmon or tuna still get the green
                    light?</p>

                <p>Here are four common seafood mistakes that could be slowing down your weight loss, plus the
                    scale-friendly facts on adding fish and shellfish to your diet.</p>
                <h3>Mistake 1: Not Eating Enough of It</h3>
                <p>Nearly half of Americans say they rarely or never eat fish, while a third spring for seafood just
                    once a week, per the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But there's no reason to avoid
                    seafood when you're trying to hit a lower number on the scale. In fact, it's one of your best menu
                    options.</p>

                <p>Regularly eating fish has been shown to have a positive effect on body weight and thyroid function
                    while reducing the risk for metabolic syndrome, concluded a June 2021 review in ​[Nutrition and
                    Metabolic Insights​](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11786388211022378).</p>

                <p>"In general, seafood is low in calories and high in protein, making it a perfect food for someone
                    trying to lose weight while maintaining muscle," explains Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN, nutrition
                    expert and author of ​Smoothies & Juices: Prevention Healing Kitchen​.</p>

                <p>A 3-ounce serving of cooked shrimp, for instance, serves up 20 grams of protein for just 84 calories,
                    according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). That's nearly as much protein as the same
                    amount of cooked rotisserie chicken breast.</p>
                <div class="my-3 bg-light rounded p-3 shadow border border-dark">
                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-danger">Fix it:​</h3>
                    <p>​ Say yes to fish more often. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 8 or more ounces of
                        seafood per week, whether you're working toward losing weight or not. Choosing a variety of fish
                        and shellfish will give you a wider variety of nutrients (kind of like eating the rainbow, but
                        for seafood!). Just be sure to limit high-mercury fish, recommends the Environmental Protection
                        Agency (EPA). These include king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, bigeye tuna
                        and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Mistake 2: Slathering It in Butter</h3>
                <p>Butter might make everything better from a flavor perspective. But smothering your seafood in the
                    golden goo can drastically increase the calorie count of your meal, which could stall your weight
                    loss.</p>

                <p>For instance? "While scallops only have 80 calories per 4 ounces, adding 2 tablespoons of butter to
                    the pan while you're cooking them will add an extra 200 calories and 14 grams of saturated fat,"
                    Largeman-Roth explains.</p>
                <div class="my-3 bg-light rounded p-3 shadow border border-dark">
                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-danger">Fix it:​</h3>
                    <p>There's no need to go totally fat-free when you're cooking seafood. But you'll shave off serious
                        calories by trading some of the fat (around 100 calories per tablespoon) for low- or no-calorie
                        flavor boosters like herbs, spices or citrus, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p>

                    <p>And for the fat you ​do ​still use, consider swapping the butter for extra-virgin olive oil,
                        Largeman-Roth recommends. The latter contains roughly the same amount of calories as butter, but
                        it's much lower in saturated fat and can help protect against high levels of bad cholesterol and
                        reduce your risk for heart disease, per Harvard Health Publishing.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Mistake 3: Frying It</h3>
                <p>That crisp, crunchy coating adds a major caloric cost to your meal, Largeman-Roth says. (Along with
                    loads of added sodium, which can leave you feeling puffy and bloated.) Case in point: A 4-ounce
                    fillet
                    of unbreaded cod serves up just 90 calories, but covering it in batter tacks on at least another 200
                    calories, plus 300 to 400 milligrams of sodium, she notes.</p>
                <div class="my-3 bg-light rounded p-3 shadow border border-dark">
                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-danger">Fix it:​</h3>
                    <p>It's fine to enjoy battered and fried seafood as a special treat, but make lower-calorie cooking
                        methods your go-to for everyday fish meals, Largeman-Roth recommends. According to the Mayo
                        Clinic, poaching, baking, braising, broiling or grilling are all tasty options that can help
                        better support your weight-loss efforts.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Mistake 4: Being Afraid of Fatty Fish</h3>
                <p>Think you need to steer clear of omega-3-rich options like salmon, tuna, mackerel or herring when
                    you're trying to lose weight? Think again.</p>

                <p>While fatty fish do contain roughly 100 more calories per serving compared to their leaner
                    counterparts, they still deserve a place in your diet, Largeman-Roth notes. Some findings suggest
                    the omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish may actually support weight loss, according to a June
                    2019 review in ​Nutrition Research Reviews​. Plus, "the fat in fatty fish provides protection for
                    our hearts and brains," says Largeman-Roth.</p>

                <div class="my-3 bg-light rounded p-3 shadow border border-dark">
                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-danger">Fix it:​</h3>
                    <p>Give fish high in omega-3s a regular place on your menu. Just pay attention to your portion size
                        and avoid using large amounts of added fat to cook or flavor your fish, which will help keep the
                        overall calorie count in check. The American Heart Association recommends enjoying a 3-ounce
                        portion of fatty fish at least twice a week.</p>
