                <p class="fw-bold">Let's face it: Avocados are somewhat of a healthy aging superfood. Eating them every
                    day has so many benefits, and avocado smoothie recipes make it easy to incorporate them into your
                    routine.</p>
                <p>But first, here's how avocados help you age healthier.</p>
                <h3>Avocados and Aging</h3>
                <p>Avocados are rich in a plethora of nutrients that support healthy aging. "Avocados are rich in
                    healthy fats, fiber and antioxidants meaning that they can improve your gut, brain and heart
                    health," says Vivian Schemper, RD.</p>

                <p>The monounsaturated fats in avocados protect your heart by keeping triglyceride and cholesterol
                    levels in check, according to a February 2016 review in the ​Journal of Clinical Lipidology​.</p>

                <p>"In addition to protecting against heart disease, avocados can improve your gut health and may play a
                    role in optimizing brain function," says Su-Nui Escobar, RD.</p>

                <p>In particular, the omega-3 fats you'll get from avocados have been linked to protection from
                    age-related brain damage, per May 2017 research in ​Nutritional Neuroscience​.</p>

                <p>Unsaturated fats and omega-3s may also help prevent or reduce symptoms of inflammatory conditions
                    like arthritis, per June 2020 research in the ​Mediterranean Journal of Rheumatology​.</p>

                <p>Skin health is another aspect of aging that your diet plays a role in. Research suggests that the
                    fatty acids and antioxidants in avocados may help with skin aging.</p>

                <p>An avocado a day may improve the elasticity and firmness of your skin, which could reduce or prevent
                    signs of aging like wrinkles and sagging, according to a January 2022 study in the ​Journal of
                    Cosmetic Dermatology​.</p>

                <p>Additionally, the antioxidants in avocados — namely lutein and zeaxanthin — may help protect your
                    eyes against age-related damage, known as macular degeneration. These antioxidants support eye
                    health by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, according to a November 2020 review in
                    ​Antioxidants​.</p>

                <p>"Eating an avocado every day will not make you 18 again, but given all the nutrients it has, it's
                    definitely worth including in your diet," Schemper says.</p>

                <p>Learn how these delicious avocado smoothies can support longevity, and sip your way to better health.

                <h3>1. Mint Chocolate Chip Avocado Smoothie</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-1.webp" alt="" class="rounded w-50 shadow mb-4">
                <p>Green smoothies don't have to be boring, and this ice-cream-inspired avocado smoothie is a great
                    example.</p>

                <p>"Spinach and banana will both contribute to overall fruit and vegetable servings, helping meet the
                    recommended servings/day to aid in the prevention of chronic disease," says Jess DeGore, RD,
                    dietitian and diabetes educator. "Leafy greens are also great sources of folate, lutein and
                    zeaxanthin — nutrients that may help reduce your risk of vision loss."</p>

                <p>Throwing mint into the mix makes this a brain-promoting drink. Peppermint has high levels of menthol
                    and methane, which have been linked to improvements in mental performance, according to an August
                    2018 study in ​Nutrients​.</p>

                <p>Additionally, the Greek yogurt in this smoothie is a good source of protein. "Protein helps improve
                    bone strength, reduces the risk of osteoporosis and promotes healthy muscles, DeGore says.
                    "Replacing the almond milk with dairy milk will boost the protein even more."</p>
                <h3>2. Pear Smoothie With Avocado and Spinach</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-2.webp" alt="" class="rounded w-50 shadow mb-4">
                <p>Full of fruits and vegetables, this avocado smoothie is full of antioxidants and vitamins. "Coconut
                    water, pears and avocados all have potassium, an electrolyte that helps you stay hydrated," Degore
                    says. "This smoothie makes a perfect post-workout snack."</p>

                <p>Potassium, an essential mineral, also helps maintain functions that may decline as we age. Potassium
                    is important for blood pressure regulation, preventing bone loss and supporting kidney health,
                    according to the Linus Pauling Institute.</p>

                <p>"The spinach in this recipe also provides calcium, which is important for bone health," DeGore says.
                    "But overall, this smoothie could be better balanced with the addition of dairy milk, Greek yogurt
                    or another protein source."</p>
                <h3>3. Avocado Pineapple Smoothie</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-3.webp" alt="" class="rounded w-50 shadow mb-4">
                <p>This just in: Not all avocado smoothies are green! A tropical, dreamy delight, this Avocado Pineapple
                    Smoothie sweetened with banana and a hint of vanilla is the perfect option for switching things up.
                </p>

                <p>"This creamy, refreshing smoothie is a delicious way to support longevity," Escobar says. "The
                    avocado and hemp seeds add a good dose of healthy fats to this recipe, making the smoothie creamy,
                    delicious and more satisfying."</p>
                <h3>4. Avocado Green Smoothie</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-4.webp" alt="" class="rounded w-50 shadow mb-4">
                <p>This delicious avocado smoothie boasts some serious tropical flavor thanks to the combination of
                    pineapple and coconut milk. Throwing in a tangy orange juice gives it a citrusy burst as well as
                    some immune-enhancing vitamin C.</p>

                <p>"This smoothie is a great way to start your day with a healthy dose of leafy green vegetables, which
                    can potentially slow down age-related cognitive decline," Escobar says.</p>

                <p>Eating one portion of leafy green vegetables a day may slow down the rate of cognitive decline pretty
                    significantly, according to a January 2018 study in the ​Journal of Neurology​.</p>
                <h3>5. Chocolate Avocado Smoothie</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-5.webp" alt="" class="rounded w-50 shadow mb-4">
                <p>Two thumbs up for the avocado in this smoothie. It is not only satisfying, but also good for your
                    heart — something we need to care for and protect, especially as we age.</p>

                <p>"Avocados are full of monounsaturated fats," says Veronika Rouse, RD, CDE. "This specific type of fat
                    will not only keep you full, but has also been shown to help reduce cholesterol levels and
                    inflammation, which in turn, helps reduce your risk of heart disease."</p>

                <p>Oats add additional fiber to the smoothie, bumping it up to 14 grams! With peanut butter as a source
                    of protein, this one is not only good for your heart, but also satisfying enough to keep you full.
                </p>
                <h3>6. Peanut Butter Avocado Smoothie</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-6.webp" alt="" class="rounded w-50 shadow mb-4">
                <p>For many older adults, weight stability may be a challenge. A calorie-and-nutrient-dense meal option
                    like this Peanut Butter Avocado Smoothie may be fitting for those needs.</p>

                <p>Loaded with nutrient-dense ingredients including dates, peanut butter and avocado, this avocado
                    smoothie can support healthy weight-gain goals. With one whole avocado, it supplies a healthy dose
                    of potassium. And bonus, it has no added sugars.</p>

                <p>One serving of this smoothie offers 688 calories and 19 grams of protein. But if weight gain is not
                    your issue, its still got plenty of anti-aging potential. So, just drink half and enjoy!</p>
