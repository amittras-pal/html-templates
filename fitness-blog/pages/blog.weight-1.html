                <p class="fw-bold">Spring is when many of us blossom — the days start getting longer, the weather is
                    warmer and the sun is brighter. But all the things that make the season so great can also sometimes
                    be causes of spring weight gain.</p>
                <p>While you might be used to gaining some weight in the winter, you may be less aware of how the pounds
                    may sneak up on you during the spring.</p>

                <p>Just know that, in general, a little weight gain is normal every now and then, in any season. But if
                    you want to enjoy the sunshine and social activities spring brings without worrying about putting on
                    a pound or two, get to know the biggest spring weight gain pitfalls so you can avoid them.</p>
                <h3>1. Holiday Eating</h3>
                <p>Winter isn't the only season for holiday celebrations that center around food. Spring holidays are
                    also a time where many people gather with their loved ones to eat and drink. And it can be hard to
                    stay mindful of how much you're eating when you're focused on being festive.</p>

                <p>"Spring contains holidays like Easter, Passover, St. Patrick's Day and Cinco de Mayo, all
                    food-centered holidays," says registered dietitian Meghan Pendleton, RD. "And the latter two are
                    also alcohol-centered, all of which makes it easy to consume more energy than our bodies need,
                    through energy-dense foods and beverages."</p>

                <div class="my-3 bg-light rounded p-3 shadow border border-dark">
                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-danger">How to Avoid Overeating During Spring Holidays</h3>
                    <p>Pendleton says the key to not overdoing it during spring festivities is to focus on mindful
                        eating and drinking — not restriction. To help you celebrate the holidays mindfully, Pendleton
                        recommends the following strategies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Collaborate on the menu:</span> ​For a potluck with friends or a
                            family gathering, talk to the host about what kind of food will be served, so you know if
                            the menu includes some healthy options. If it doesn't, you can bring a nutritious dish and
                            still eat what's being served in a balanced way. Collaborating on the menu also gives you a
                            chance to communicate any boundaries around food and weight that you might have.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">​Don't restrict your eating:</span> ​Vowing not to eat certain foods,
                            can do more harm than good. "A heavy focus on restriction can actually make us more
                            preoccupied with food, increase our perceived palatability of food and decrease our feelings
                            of satiety — which can all lead to overeating," Pendleton says.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">​Enjoy cultural foods:</span> ​Eating mindfully during the holidays
                            means allowing yourself to enjoy cultural and traditional foods.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>2. Daylight Saving Time</h3>
                <p>Who doesn't love an extra hour of sunlight? While more daylight is great, in addition to affecting
                    your sleep, daylight saving time could also bring about changes in appetite. "The time change brings
                    more daylight, and so since we're awake for longer, we may be more inclined to eat more," Pendleton
                    says.</p>

                <p>Some research has found a link between sleep deprivation and increased eating, per the Harvard T.H.
                    Chan School of Public Health. The loss of an hour of rest that comes with the start of daylight
                    saving time could result in you feeling hungrier and eating more.</p>

                <p>The researchers behind an August 2013 study in ​Nature Communications​ found an association between
                    sleep deprivation and an increased risk of obesity, because it's possible for sleep deprivation to
                    alter the hormones that regulate our appetite and lead to increased eating.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-danger">How to Get More Sleep During Daylight Saving Time</h3>
                    <p>It's important to establish and keep healthy sleep habits, especially during the time change that
                        comes with the spring. Here are some habits that can help you get good sleep this season, per
                        the Cleveland Clinic:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Slow your body down before bed:</span>​ Raising your body's core
                            temperature before bed can make it harder to rest, so avoid heavy workouts before bed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">​Put away your electronics:</span> ​The light from your devices can
                            hinder the production of melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone. Tuck away your phone or
                            tablet at least an hour before bed and opt for a book or meditation instead.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">​Be consistent:</span> ​Try to get the same amount of sleep each
                            night.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">​Reserve your bed for sleep:</span> ​Try to avoid working from your
                            bed during the day, which could make it harder to fall asleep at night.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>3. Stress</h3>
                <p>The spring can bring a lot of joy, but it may also bring some stress. You could feel pressure to
                    accept every invitation to be social, for example, and with COVID-19 still being a concern, you may
                    have stress or anxiety about being around maskless people or crowds.</p>

                <p>And when you're stressed, you may look to food for comfort. Being in physical or emotional distress
                    can also make you more likely to crave foods that are high in fat and sugar, per Harvard Health
                    Publishing. And stress-eating could lead to weight gain over time.</p>

                <p>Finding ways to de-stress that don't revolve around food can help keep weight gain at bay.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-danger">How to Manage Stress During the Spring</h3>
                    <p>Some ways to manage stress, per Harvard Health Publishing, include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">​Meditation techniques:</span>​ Mindfulness meditation, in particular
                            can help you make more mindful food choices.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">​Exercise:</span>​ Exercises like yoga offer a meditation component.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">​Social support:</span>​ Adequate social support may help you beat
                            stress. Turning to friends who understand your spring-related stress may be especially
                            helpful.
