                <p class="fw-bold">Whether you're going for a long run outdoors or spending time in the pool, it's
                    essential to protect your skin against harmful UV rays. But to do that, you'll need a
                    water-resistant sunscreen.</p>
                <p>Unlike regular sunscreen, water-resistant ones are less likely to wash off when in water or when
                    performing sweat-inducing activities.</p>

                <p>"Although there is technically no such thing as waterproof sunscreen, there are formulas that are
                    water-resistant, and this will be indicated on the label, along with the amount of time users should
                    expect that it will remain effective when exposed to water," says Rebecca Marcus, MD,
                    board-certified dermatologist and founder of Maei MD.</p>
                <h2>How We Chose</h2>
                <p>We reached out to a dermatologist, who offered recommendations and broke down what to look for when
                    shopping for water-resistant sunscreens. We selected the following products based on criteria
                    including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Duration of water-resistance</li>
                    <li>Ingredients</li>
                    <li>SPF</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>1. Best Overall: Blue Lizard Sensitive Mineral SPF 50 Sunscreen Lotion</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-24.webp" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>This sunscreen comes highly recommended by Dr. Marcus for its mineral-based formula. Mineral
                    sunscreens use active ingredients such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which serve as a physical
                    barrier to block UV rays. (By contrast, chemical sunscreens absorb into the skin.)</p>

                <p>This one has 8 percent titanium dioxide and 10 percent zinc oxide to protect against both UVA and UVB
                    rays.</p>

                <p>Not only is it easily spreadable, it "absorbs well into the skin," Dr. Marcus says.</p>

                <p>It also offers 80 minutes of sweat- and water-resistance, and it's free of parabens and fragrance,
                    making it ideal for all skin types, including sensitive skin.</p>
                <h3>2. Best for Face: EltaMD Sport Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Sunscreen</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-25.webp" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>Whether you're going for a run or taking a dip in the pool, Dr. Marcus recommends Elta MD's SPF 50
                    sunscreen for your face because it's sweat- and water-resistant for up to 80 minutes.</p>

                <p>Formulated with beeswax and castor oil, the sunscreen is super hydrating and smooth to apply.</p>

                <p>For best use, it's recommended to apply 30 minutes before sun exposure and every two to three hours
                    to maintain protection.</p>


                <h3>3. Best for Swimming: Supergoop Play SPF 50 Sunscreen Lotion</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-26.webp" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>Despite launching in 2007, Supergoop has risen in popularity in recent years, becoming a favorite
                    among beauty fanatics, influencers and sun-tanners.</p>

                <p>If you're looking for sunscreen for swimming, look no further than Supergoop Play SPF 50. It's ideal
                    for swimming because it has "a hydrating formula that is water-resistant for 80 minutes, allowing
                    for plenty of time between reapplications," says Dr. Marcus.</p>

                <p>It also comes in a large container, which encourages liberal use, she adds.</p>


                <h3>4. Best for Surfing: Sun Bum SPF 50 Sunscreen Spray</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-27.webp" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>We recommend Sun Bum's SPF 50 sunscreen for surfing because it's resistant to water for up to 80
                    minutes and comes in a spray can, making for easy application between rides.</p>

                <p>Enriched with vitamin E, the sunscreen works to prevent free radicals from damaging and aging your
                    skin. Additionally, it's free of oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are ingredients that can harm
                    coral reefs, making this product "reef-friendly."</p>


                <h3>5. Best for Sensitive Skin: La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral SPF 50 Sunscreen</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-28.webp" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>Sunscreens can be formulated with chemicals that irritate the skin, but this 100 percent mineral
                    sunscreen is free of oil, parabens, chemical sunscreen filters, fragrance, oxybenzone and
                    octinoxate, making a skin breakout unlikely.</p>

                <p>The formula is weightless, fast-absorbing and leaves a matte finish. Plus, it received the seal of
                    approval from the Skin Cancer Foundation.</p>
                <p>Beyond these attributes, it offers protection for up to 40 minutes and is infused with senna alata
                    extract, a tropical plant leaf that prevents skin aging.</p>


                <h3>6. Best Stick: Shiseido SPF 50 Clear Sunscreen Stick</h3>
                <img src="../static/images/blog-content-29'=.webp" alt="" class="w-100 rounded mb-4">
                <p>Shiseido's SPF 50 water-resistant sunscreen offers up to 80 minutes of protection. It's formulated
                    with the brand's signature technology, which creates an invisible, protective layer in water and
                    heat. You can easily apply this sunscreen thanks to the stick applicator. Simply twist the knob and
                    apply generously over your face and neck. It works on normal, combination, dry, and oily skin types
                    and glides over makeup smoothly.</p>

                <h3> What to Look for in Waterproof Sunscreens</h3>
                <h4>1. Ingredients</h4>
                <p>Not all water-resistant sunscreens are made the same, so you'll want to choose ones with active
                    ingredients that block UV rays, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.</p>

                <p>Watch out for ingredients that can irritate the skin like fragrance, parabens and chemical filters.
                </p>

                <p>Additionally, it's best to look for a formula that states it is non-comedogenic, so it will not clog
                    pores and potentially contribute to acne breakouts, Dr. Marcus says.</p>

                <h4>2. SPF</h4>
                <p>SPF, also known as the sun protection factor, is an indicator of how well your sunscreen protects
                    against UVB rays.</p>

                <p>According to Dr. Marcus, sunscreens should be SPF 30 or higher.</p>

                <p>It's important to note that a higher SPF does not mean more protection. For best protection, it's
                    best to reapply several times throughout the day and follow the product's instructions.</p>

                <h4>3. Duration of Water-Resistance</h4>
                <p>Water-resistant sunscreens will have a water-resistance duration printed on the label, usually
                    ranging between 40 and 80 minutes.</p>

                <p>If a product is water-resistant for 80 minutes, you should reapply a little before the 80-minute
                    window ends for the best protection.</p>
