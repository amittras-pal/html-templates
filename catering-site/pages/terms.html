                <p class="h2 text-uppercase">Menu Selection</p>
                <p>All our menus have been designed to give you a balanced selection. This is based on seasonal
                    availability, ratio of meat, fish and vegetarian, colour, cooking processes and variety of textures.
                    We only use the freshest ingredients from nominated suppliers.</p>

                <p>Most dietary requirements can be catered for, due to the necessary strict requirements we cannot
                    provide Kosher food, however we can provide vegan food. We can also provide certain Halal products
                    which are available upon request. We can also provide vegan, gluten free, dairy free, nut free and
                    halal specific food. All dietary meals will be individually served.</p>

                <p class="h2 text-uppercase">Payment</p>
                <p>A deposit will be required of 20% of the original estimate to secure the service of Caramel Catering
                    Company. Full payment is required no later than 14 days prior to the day of the event. Full payment
                    is required, less deposit.</p>

                <p>Payment shall be made by BACS transfer or by credit / debit card (subject to a 2.5% handling charge
                    for credit card transactions). Cash will only be accepted with the prior agreement of the Supplier.
                </p>
                <p>The Charges do not include the cost of breakage or loss of or damage to the Supplier’s equipment,
                    tableware, cutlery or linen etc. for which we reserve the right to charge the Customer after the
                    Event provided that notification of such breakage or damage is provided to the Customer within 14
                    days after the Event.</p>

                <p>All Charges quoted are exclusive of VAT, which shall be payable by the Customer at the prevailing
                    rate upon submission of a VAT invoice by the Caramel Catering unless otherwise stated.</p>

                <p class="h2 text-uppercase">Booking</p>
                <p>Provisionally booked dates will be held for 14 days and can only be confirmed once the deposit and
                    the booking form have been received.</p>

                <p>In the event that another Customer wishes to book an event for the same date as the event prior to
                    the Customer having paid any deposit element of the Charges, we will notify the Customer and request
                    payment of the deposit of the Charges from the Customer within 48 hours of notification in order to
                    secure the provisional date allocated to the Event.</p>

                <p>For Events booked at short notice, which shall be determined by the Supplier based on the type and
                    size of event, the Customer will be invoiced for all Charges on signature of the Event Details or
                    provision of confirmation of acknowledgement of order and shall pay the Charges within 7 days of the
                    date of the invoice.</p>

                <p>The Customer must notify the Supplier of final attendee numbers for the Event no later than 14 days
                    in advance of the Event, as well as confirming all other provisional details such as any special
                    dietary requirements.</p>

                <p class="h2 text-uppercase">Cancellation</p>
                <p>The Customer acknowledges and recognises that Caramel Catering needs to purchase food and other
                    consumables in advance of the Event at the time of a cancellation or a reduction in the numbers of
                    persons attending the Event the Supplier may have already purchased the food and other consumables
                    and may not be able to use the food for any other Event, or the food may not be appropriate for any
                    other Event that the Supplier is undertaking or food will deteriorate or become unfit for human
                    consumption if not used by a particular date or by any given ‘use by’ dates. Also when equipment and
                    hired labour is needed to cater the Event. In the event of a cancellation or reduction in the number
                    of persons attending the Event, we will still be required to pay for hire of equipment and hired
                    labour whether or not the Event takes place or whether it takes place with fewer persons attending.
                </p>
                <p>Under normal circumstances, 2 weeks’ notice of cancellation is sufficient. Events cancelled with less
                    than 2 weeks will be charged in the following way:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>7-10 days 50% of estimated final invoice</li>
                    <li>4-6 days 75% of estimated final invoice</li>
                    <li>1-3 days 90% of estimated final invoice</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Caramel Catering Company may terminate the agreement liability of any nature upon return of deposit.
                </p>
                <p>Caramel Catering Company will not be liable for consequential damage of any nature for any reason as
                    a
                    result of any act or circumstance beyond reasonable control including but not limited to, strikes,
                    acts of God, fire, flood, accident or act of war. In the event of such an event occurring the
                    Supplier shall be entitled to cancel the Event with immediate notice to the Customer and shall
                    reimburse the Customer all Charges paid as at the date of cancellation less such reasonable
                    preparation and administration costs of the Supplier and any non-refundable deposits paid by the
                    Supplier to third party suppliers of services for the Event.</p>

                <p class="h2 text-uppercase">Supplier requirements</p>
                <p>Caramel Catering requires access to the Location for setting up equipment and services, ideally the
                    day before the Event if not in good time on the day of the Event.</p>

                <p>Caramel Catering and staff, will require constant access to and exit from the Location while they are
                    providing the Catering Services. The Customer must ensure that Caramel Catering can enter and leave
                    the Location without excessive restriction.</p>

                <p>While at the Location and providing the Services, Caramel Catering will need access to a sink with
                    hot
                    and cold water supply and access to clean certified drinking water. As well as access to appropriate
                    cooking and preparation facilities. Where the Event is being held in a temporary structure such as a
                    marquee, provision of a catering tent next to or within a reasonable proximity of the temporary
                    structure needs to be provided along with uninterrupted power supply sufficient to cover all of the
                    needs of Caramel Catering at the Event. To have use of a parking space and/or parking permit
                    throughout the time Caramel Catering and representatives are providing the Catering Services as well
                    access to toilet facilities.</p>

                <p class="h2 text-uppercase">Quality Assurance</p>
                <p>Under the Government Food Hygiene regulations all cold food should be consumed within FOUR hours of
                    delivery. Hot food should be consumed within 2 hours, thereafter it is your responsibility when food
                    which is left unsupervised by the consent of the client is NOT covered under our Public Liability
                    Insurance.</p>

                <p>Where the Customer chooses to supply items of food and/or drink itself for the Event, the Supplier
                    will comply with condition to the extent that it prepares and/or serves any such items but reserves
                    the right to dispose of or not to serve any such item if, in its sole discretion, such item is unfit
                    for human consumption and/or displays signs of contamination or deterioration and/or cannot be
                    demonstrated to have been stored in accordance with statutory and/or regulatory requirements prior
                    to delivery to the Supplier at the Event.</p>

                <p>All excess food at the Location at the end of the Event shall be removed and disposed of by Caramel
                    Catering in accordance with prevailing statutory food hygiene requirements save where such food or
                    drink has been supplied by the Customer in which event the Customer shall be responsible for
                    removing excess food or drink and empty bottles unless otherwise agreed by us.</p>

                <p>We shall provide the Catering Services with reasonable care and skill and in accordance with food
                    catering industry standards for hygiene and general cleanliness. The preparation and cooking of food
                    and the handling and service of food, beverages, utensils and tableware. In compliance with
                    statutory and regulatory requirements affecting the preparation, cooking, handling and service of
                    food.</p>
                <p>As we continually strive to improve the quality of our service we welcome your feedback. From your
                    comments we will be able to improve our service.</p>

                <p>We value our customer’s feedback and will always follow up on comments.</p>

                <p class="h2 text-uppercase">Environmentally Aware</p>
                <p>We are fully aware of the environmental issues that we all need to take responsibility for and
                    wherever possible we want to play a role in helping the environment. Wherever possible we use local
                    suppliers to reduce our carbon footprint. We also try to arrange deliveries together to minimise our
                    carbon emissions.</p>

                <p class="h2 text-uppercase">Data Protection</p>
                <p>We will process any personal data collected from the Customer for the purposes of administering the
                    booking for the Event. We may also process such data to provide the Customer from time-to-time with
                    information on other services that it provides and other events organised by us if we feel that it
                    will be of interest to the customer. We will not give your details out to any third parties</p>
